Though, I have found some gems in Udemy like Angular Complete Guide by Max and his other courses on React. Similarly, Colt_Steele’s courses on Web Development and Algorithms are excellent, and so is Stephen Grider’s JavaScript and other courses.

Similarly, Jose Portilla’s The Complete Python 3 Bootcamp and Python for Data Science Bootcamp courses are also good, and So is Ryan Kroonenburg’s Cloud courses and Kirill Eremenko Machine Learning and AI courses.
